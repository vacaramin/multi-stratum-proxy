# Multi Stratum Proxy
This repository is a re-implementation of [Mekas17](https://github.com/mekas17/multi-stratum-proxy)'s multi-stratum-proxy originally written in JavaScript, now rewritten in GoLang.

## Description
The multi-stratum-proxy project serves as a bidirectional proxy for handling miners and communication with mining pools in the context of different cryptocurrencies. It facilitates parallel processing of miner hashrates, allowing for splitting the hashrate among multiple pools in varying proportions.

## Features
- Bidirectional proxy functionality.
- Communication with multiple mining pools simultaneously.
- Splitting of miner hashrates among different pools.
- Parallel processing to increase overall hashrate efficiency.
